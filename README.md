This addon integrates [Sinon](http://jhawk.co/sinonjs) & [Ember-QUnit](http://jhawk.co/ember-qunit) 
via [Ember-Sinon](http://jhawk.co/ember-sinon), as inspired by [Sinon-QUnit](http://jhawk.co/sinon-qunit).

Why not simply use Ember-Sinon? Two reasons:

1. Ember-Sinon does not handle cleanup of Ember-QUnit tests. Ember-Sinon-QUnit provides a test method 
that wraps Ember-QUnit while making each test callback a sandboxed Sinon environment. All spies/stubs created
via the sandbox will be automatically restored to their original methods at the end of each test.
2. Sinon is a framework-agnostic library; as such, Ember-Sinon should be as well. This addon exists to enable
Ember-Sinon to remove its QUnit specific functionality, making it easier to utilize Ember-Sinon 
with other addons like [Ember-CLI-Mocha](http://jhawk.co/ember-cli-mocha), for example.

## Installation

`ember install ember-sinon-qunit`

## Usage

Import Ember-Sinon-QUnit's `test` method into your tests in place of Ember-QUnit's test. This creates a Sinon `sandbox`
around that test via Sinon's `test` API. Then, you can access Sinon's `spy`, `stub`, `mock`, and `sandbox` methods
via `this` within the test callback:

```javascript
import { moduleFor } from 'ember-qunit';
import test from 'ember-sinon-qunit/test-support/test';

moduleFor('route:foo', 'Unit | Route | foo');

test('fooTransition action transitions to bar route', function (assert) {
  const route = this.subject();
  const stub = this.stub(route, 'transitionTo');
  
  route.send('fooTransition');
  
  assert.ok(stub.calledOnce, 'transitionTo was called once');
  assert.ok(stub.calledWithExactly('bar'), 'bar was passed to transitionTo');
});
```

That's it! You can use this `test` method in place of all Ember-QUnit tests if you want, without any 
loss of functionality. Or, you can import them both into the same test to be used only when you need Sinon:

```javascript
import { moduleFor, test } from 'ember-qunit';
import sinonTest from 'ember-sinon-qunit/test-support/test';
```
