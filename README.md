This addon integrates [`sinon`](http://jhawk.co/sinonjs) & [`ember-qunit`](http://jhawk.co/ember-qunit).

Why not simply use `sinon` alone?

`sinon` does not handle cleanup of `ember-qunit` tests. While `sinon`
[sandboxes itself](https://sinonjs.org/guides/migrating-to-5.0), it's up to the user to
consistently clean up `sinon` after each test. `ember-sinon-qunit` automatically
restores `sinon`'s state to ensure nothing is leaked between tests. All spies/stubs created
will be automatically restored to their original methods at the end of each test.

## Compatibility

- Sinon.js v15 or above
- Ember.js v4.12 or above
- Embroider or ember-auto-import v2

## Installation

```
ember install ember-sinon-qunit
```

`sinon` is a peerDependency of this addon, so install it with your favorite package manager as well, e.g. `yarn add -D sinon`.

## Usage

To use, import the setup method into your `tests/test-helper.js` file and execute it.

```js
import { setApplication } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { start } from 'ember-qunit';
import Application from '../app';
import config from '../config/environment';
import setupSinon from 'ember-sinon-qunit';

setApplication(Application.create(config.APP));

setupSinon();

start();
```

This will automatically wire-up `sinon`'s setup & restoration to QUnit's `testStart` and `testDone` respectively.

#### Accessing `sinon` Within Tests

In each test you are able to access `sinon` via the `sinon` object available as an import in your tests:

```js
import { module } from 'qunit';
import { test } from 'ember-qunit';
import sinon from 'sinon';

module('Example test', function (hooks) {
  hooks.beforeEach(function () {
    this.testStub = sinon.stub();
  });

  test('sinon is wired up correctly', function (assert) {
    this.testStub();

    assert.ok(this.testStub.calledOnce, 'stub was called once');
  });

  test('sinon state restored after every test run', function (assert) {
    assert.ok(this.testStub.notCalled, 'stub cleaned up after each test run');
  });
});
```

The `sinon` object's state is automatically self-contained to each specific test, allowing you to
safely create mocks for your tests without worrying about any overrides leaking between each test.

#### Using sinon with the `@action` decorator

The `@action` decorator is used with methods to bind them to the `this` of the class. The `@action`
does this by wrapping the method in a property with the `getter` of the property returning the
original method bound to `this`. That means when you wish to stub or spy the method, you have to treat it as a
property not a method.

```js
let stubAction = sinon.stub(service, 'methodToStub').get(function () {
  return null;
});

let spyAction = sinon.spy(service, 'methodToStub', ['get']);

assert.ok(stubAction.get.calledOnce);
assert.ok(spyAction.get.calledOnce);
```

## Migrating To `ember-sinon-qunit`

| Read this [post](https://www.jordanhawker.com/p/187541610821) to learn more about the overhaul of this package. |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

The above functionality replaces previous features within `ember-sinon-qunit`,
as well as the sister addons [`ember-sinon-sinoff`](https://github.com/scalvert/ember-sinon-sinoff)
and [`ember-sinon-sandbox`](https://github.com/scalvert/ember-sinon-sandbox).
Below, you will find simple instructions for migrating from each of these feature sets to the new patterns.

### Migration from `sinon` 5+

1. Import and consume `setupSinon`.
1. Remove any manual calls to `sinon.restore()`. It won't hurt to leave them, but they are redundant now!

### Migration from older versions of `sinon`

1. Import and consume `setupSinon`.
1. Remove calls to `sinon.createSandbox()`. Anywhere you used the `sandbox` object returned by this method,
   you can now use `sinon` directly. See the [`sinon` Migration Guide](https://sinonjs.org/guides/migrating-to-5.0)
   for more information.
1. Remove any manual `restore()` calls for your sandboxes.

### Migration from older versions of `ember-sinon-qunit`

1. Revert to using the standard [`ember-qunit`](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit) test import:
   `import { test } from 'qunit';`
1. Import and consume `setupSinon`.

### Migration from `ember-sinon-sinoff` or `ember-sinon-sandbox`

1. `import sinon from 'sinon';` within each test that currently uses a `sandbox`.
1. Replace `this.sandbox` with the imported `sinon` object.
1. Remove references to `setupSinonSinoff`/`setupSinonSandbox` from your tests.
1. Import and consume `setupSinon`.

Or, if you'd like to save some effort, try the following codemod [`ember-sinon-qunit-codemod`](https://github.com/sunwrobert/ember-sinon-qunit-codemod):

```bash
cd my-ember-app-or-addon
npx ember-sinon-qunit-codemod tests
```
